# dbt_streaming_analysis
The mini project for the course Database Technologies. 
## Technologies / Frameworks to be exercised:
* 1. Apache Spark Streaming, Spark SQL [execute multiple workloads e.g., Spark
  SQL queries to carry out action, transformation or aggregation on the input data]
* 2. Apache Kafka Streaming [have to publish/subscribe the results or
  produce/consume choosing >=3 topics].
* 3. Store the data in a DBMS of your choice like postgres, MySQL.
* 4. Make use of any other tool/s as required like Zookeeper.
## Run the same queries in a batch mode on the same/whole data from the database (#3
above).
## Compare the above results/accuracy/performance with the streaming mode of
execution.
